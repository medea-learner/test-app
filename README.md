# Test App | Django

This project contains two main parts :
the first one consists of a Rest Api that allows users to manage a collection of books
The second one is a task manager app that presents the following features :
    1. It allows multiple user registration
    2. each user registered can have mutiple roles including manager and worker roles
    3. only the users with manager role can create new tasks

Notes:
    1. The current version doesn't create the manager and worker roles automatically 
       so you have to create them manually via the admin panel -> Roles admin view
